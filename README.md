# Rehearsal

Rehearsal tests pending Supabase migrations against a verified, sanitized,
production-shaped baseline in a disposable local environment. It is designed for the
historical edge cases that synthetic seed data rarely represents.

Version 0.1 targets Supabase CLI projects running PostgreSQL locally. It does not yet
claim support for arbitrary unmanaged PostgreSQL installations.

Public beta releases are distributed through npm as `@rehearsal-db/core`. Publication is
restricted to reviewed artifacts from protected `main`; source availability alone does
not enable production access.

## Why use it?

A migration passing against an empty database proves only that the migration can build
a new schema. Rehearsal also proves that:

- the baseline is the exact immutable artifact you reviewed;
- historical migration files still match the baseline's digest-addressed prefix;
- only the exact suffix is treated as candidate work;
- production-shaped relationships survive restore and migration;
- optional bounded Storage objects retain exact checksums through local restore;
- the resulting local application can pass a project-owned proof;
- unsafe or ambiguous state stops execution.

## What Rehearsal is—and is not

Rehearsal complements existing database workflows instead of replacing them:

| Tool or environment                             | Primary job                                 | What Rehearsal adds                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backups and point-in-time recovery              | Recover lost production data                | A disposable, writable migration test; Rehearsal is not disaster recovery.                                                 |
| Staging                                         | Exercise an integrated deployed application | A local resettable database shaped by reviewed production history, without giving the runtime a hosted target.             |
| Synthetic seed data                             | Create small, known test scenarios          | Sanitized production-shaped relationships and historical edge cases, when the project explicitly authorizes them.          |
| Database branches or preview databases          | Isolate hosted database changes             | A loopback-only runtime with immutable baseline checks, exact candidate confirmation, and project-owned acceptance proofs. |
| Migration linters and migration-only test tools | Inspect SQL or prove a migration applies    | Restore, migrate, run the real application proof, preserve sandbox edits, and reset to the verified baseline.              |

The package does not extract production data. A project may use Rehearsal entirely with
synthetic data, or build its own least-privilege extraction and sanitization boundary.
The current beta runs local Supabase services and therefore does not support an arbitrary
unmanaged PostgreSQL server.

## Local cost and storage

Rehearsal itself has no hosted-service fee and never creates a cloud database. Normal
local costs are Docker CPU, memory, and disk space for Supabase images, the immutable
baseline, optional retained Storage assets, and the disposable runtime. Production-shaped
artifacts can be large: review their manifest size before activation, keep bounded
retention, and use `rehearsal discard` when the runtime is no longer needed. Deleting the
runtime does not delete the immutable baseline; baseline retention remains a project-owned
privacy and disk-management decision.

The restored runtime is intentionally writable. Exact baseline row counts and foreign
keys are proved during reset before the runtime is accepted; later verification allows
row-level divergence from sandbox interaction or candidate data migrations while still
checking the immutable artifact, migration lineage, runtime boundary, and project-owned
invariants. Reset restores and reproves the exact starting data.

## Quick start

Install the current beta from npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @rehearsal-db/core@beta
```

Contributors testing an unreleased change can use `npm link` or install the tarball
produced by `npm pack` from a local checkout. In a consuming project, the commands are:

```bash
npx rehearsal init
npx rehearsal init --write
npx rehearsal baseline create --records=<safe.ndjson> --ledger=<ledger.json>
npx rehearsal doctor
npx rehearsal explain
npx rehearsal run --dry-run
npx rehearsal candidates
npx rehearsal inspect baseline
npx rehearsal inspect migrations
npx rehearsal start
npx rehearsal migrate --confirm-candidates=<sha256>
npx rehearsal status
npx rehearsal verify
npx rehearsal reset
npx rehearsal stop
npx rehearsal discard
```

`init` previews a type-aware ESM `rehearsal.config.mjs`; it writes only with `--write`
and never overwrites an existing file. The explicit `.mjs` extension makes the generated
configuration executable in both CommonJS and ESM projects. Review all detected values.
Rehearsal intentionally does not detect, copy, or enable a hosted project.

`doctor` must end with `READY` before execution. `explain` and `run --dry-run` use the
same immutable planner and perform no state-changing operations. If migrations are
pending, execution requires the exact candidate digest printed by the plan:

```bash
npx rehearsal run --confirm-candidates=<sha256>
```

The `rehearsal` executable is the public command contract. Repository availability does
not itself authorize an npm publication.

To try the entire workflow without configuring a project or touching hosted data, clone
this repository and run `npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm run test:fixture`. It installs
the exact packed artifact into a clean synthetic Supabase project and proves both
success and failure.

## Configuration

Configuration has an explicit schema version. Version 1 rejects unknown versions,
unknown properties, paths outside the project root, non-loopback targets, duplicate or
privileged ports, enabled hosted access, and permissive outbound networking.

```ts
import { defineRehearsalConfig } from "@rehearsal-db/core";

export default defineRehearsalConfig({
  schemaVersion: 1,
  project: { name: "my-supabase-app" },
  supabase: {

Most projects should not use `runtimeAdapter`. It exists for a project that must create
synthetic local identities or add application-specific variables after a successful
restore. The adapter is project-owned, receives only the verified local environment and
baseline plus a local PostgreSQL executor, and is never bundled into the reusable
package. Its `configureRuntime` export returns a status message and explicit environment
variables. It must not read hosted credentials or perform network work.

## What each command proves

### `rehearsal doctor`

Doctor checks Node 24, the Supabase CLI, a running Docker-compatible engine, required
paths, config/runtime port agreement, baseline checksums and permissions, migration
prefix integrity, application proof command ownership, and the fail-closed safety
policy. Ambient hosted credential variables are reported only by name and remain
quarantined from children.

### `rehearsal explain` and `rehearsal run --dry-run`

Both return the same plan data. They may read and hash configuration, migrations,
policy, and baseline metadata. They never start or stop services, restore rows, apply a
migration, launch the application, write a receipt, change an artifact, or contact a
hosted resource.

### `rehearsal inspect baseline`

Inspection prints format and generation identifiers, the migration cutoff, table and
row counts, and hashes for baseline data and sanitization policy. It never prints source
rows or baseline values.

### `rehearsal inspect migrations`

Every local migration receives one interpretation:

- `represented_by_baseline`: exact filename and SHA-256 in the baseline prefix;
- `candidate`: exact suffix after that prefix, not yet proven in the current runtime;
- `applied_to_current_runtime`: the exact suffix digest has a verified local receipt;
- `modified`: a prefix filename or digest changed, so planning fails closed;
- `invalid`: filename, ordering, uniqueness, or source structure is invalid.

`rehearsal candidates` is the concise machine-friendly alias for this same migration
inspection and exact candidate digest. It does not apply a migration.

## Machine output and exit codes

Commands that report state accept `--json`. The version-1 envelope contains
`schemaVersion`, `command`, `status`, `startedAt`, `durationMs`, `warnings`, and `data`.
Failures contain a versioned error with category, stable code, message, expected and
actual state, context, refused action, suggestions, and a safe diagnostic identifier.

| Exit | Category                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 0    | Success                        |
| 1    | Doctor completed but not ready |
| 2    | Configuration invalid          |
| 3    | Unsafe environment             |
| 4    | Baseline invalid               |
| 5    | Baseline checksum mismatch     |
| 6    | Migration candidate failure    |
| 7    | Migration verification failure |
| 8    | Application proof failure      |
| 9    | Runtime or dependency failure  |
| 10   | Unexpected internal failure    |

Human and JSON output are projections of the same model. `normal`, `--verbose`, and
`--debug` increase explanation only; none may print secrets or baseline row values.

## Guarantees

Rehearsal version 1 intends to guarantee:

- configuration and runtime targets are local-only;
- hosted application/database credentials are neither required nor inherited by child processes;
- application, provider-data, email, and hosted-database side effects fail closed;
- any declared external identity exchange terminates in the local Auth service and its
  credentials are read from an exact owner-only allowlist;
- an active baseline verifies before restore;
- migration identity uses ordered content digests, not timestamps alone;
- a changed prefix is never silently reinterpreted as a candidate;
- restore and migration failures cannot leave a runtime marked trusted;
- reports omit source rows and redact credentials, connection strings, keys, tokens,
  JWTs, passwords, and sensitive environment values.

Independent barriers include strict loopback config, a dedicated unlinked Supabase
workdir/project ID, an allowlisted child environment, and application egress denial.
A project may explicitly declare an external identity provider, but that does not grant
hosted application/database access. A single ambient connection string is therefore
insufficient to redirect an operation.

## Non-guarantees and user responsibilities

Rehearsal does not prove that a migration is semantically correct for every application
workflow, replace backups or disaster recovery, authorize production access, or make a
sanitization policy correct merely because it is exhaustive. Project owners must review
the policy, protect baseline artifacts, write meaningful application proofs, review the
candidate digest, and keep production credentials outside the Rehearsal configuration.

## Baseline lifecycle

The source boundary exposes only reviewed versioned views through a least-privilege
read-only role. Every included column has an explicit KEEP, PSEUDONYMIZE, REPLACE,
EXCLUDE, or DERIVE action. Sanitized rows stream into an owner-only build directory.
Only after exact hashes, counts, migration receipts, and policy metadata exist does an
atomic pointer activate the generation. Failed builds cannot replace the current
baseline.

Restore replays the immutable historical migration bundle, streams sanitized rows into
the disposable local database, restores optional checksummed Storage assets through the
loopback service, restores normal enforcement, and verifies counts and foreign keys
before candidate work begins. The package accepts project-owned asset bytes; it does not
know how to authorize or extract them from a hosted source.

Project policies may attach field-aware JSON rules and project-owned identity adapters.
A consuming project can use those boundaries to preserve reviewed application data
while sanitizing unrelated private values, without teaching the package its table
names, identity relationships, or privacy decisions.

## CI example

The tracked [verification workflow](.github/workflows/verify.yml) is intentionally based
on the synthetic independent fixture. A real repository should provide its own protected
sanitized baseline through an approved artifact mechanism; never commit production data
or credentials just to make CI convenient.

## Run the independent proof

From this repository on Node.js 24 with Docker running:

```bash
npm run test:fixture
```

The proof copies the tracked synthetic fixture to a disposable directory, builds its
one-row and one-asset baseline, runs the public CLI through one valid migration and
application proof, verifies the exact Storage byte, then introduces invalid PostgreSQL.
Success means the valid migration preserved its row and asset, the invalid migration
received the intended stable failure category, and the untrusted runtime was removed.
It neither needs nor inherits application-specific or hosted credentials.

## Support matrix for the first beta

## Troubleshooting

- `NOT READY` after Docker: start Docker Desktop or Colima, then rerun doctor.
- Baseline checksum mismatch: do not repair the hash manually. Rebuild through the
  reviewed extraction/sanitization workflow.
- Migration prefix divergence: restore the exact reviewed historical file or create a
  new baseline; never rename the edited file into the candidate suffix.
- Candidate confirmation mismatch: rerun explain, review the exact ordered candidates,
  and use the new digest only if those files are intended.
- Hosted target refusal: remove the hosted value. Version 1 has no override.
- Application proof failure: inspect the project-owned proof output; the database must
  not be treated as verified.
